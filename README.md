Repositorio de curso inicial a programar con R
My name is Arturo Peñaloza. I'm an *Internal Medicine Resident* from México.
Very excited to learn how to program whit R.
The reasons I'm on this **new journey** are:
1. Make papers to improve the knowledge, focus on nephrology
2. It looks so fun to learn to program because it is the future in soo many fields, even medicine.
